## Classes, Public and Private access modifiers:

## üî∑ 1. **What is a Class?**

> A **class** is a **user-defined data type** that holds **data (variables)** and **functions** together.

A class is like a **blueprint** for creating **objects**.

---

### ‚úÖ Syntax of a Class:

```cpp
class ClassName {
    // Access modifier
public:
    // accessible everywhere

private:
    // accessible only inside the class
};
```
---

## üî∑ 2. **Access Modifiers**

Access modifiers decide **who can access what** in a class.

| Modifier    | Access Scope                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `public`    | Accessible from **anywhere** (inside or outside class) |
| `private`   | Accessible **only within the class**                   |
| `protected` | (covered in inheritance, used in derived classes)      |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

* By default, **members of a class are `private`**.
* Use `public` for functions that should be accessed from outside.
* Use `private` to **protect sensitive data**.

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Term    | Meaning                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Class   | Blueprint to create objects    |
| Object  | Real instance of a class       |
| Public  | Can be accessed from outside   |
| Private | Only accessed within the class |

---

### üß† Why Use Access Modifiers?

‚úÖ Helps in **data hiding** (important OOP concept)
‚úÖ Prevents **unauthorized access**
‚úÖ Makes code **secure and modular**

---

### üîß Bonus Tip:

You can also declare:

```cpp
class MyClass {
    int x;         // private by default
public:
    int y;
};
```
