## Classes, Public and Private access modifiers:

## 🔷 1. **What is a Class?**

> A **class** is a **user-defined data type** that holds **data (variables)** and **functions** together.

A class is like a **blueprint** for creating **objects**.

---

### ✅ Syntax of a Class:

```cpp
class ClassName {
    // Access modifier
public:
    // accessible everywhere

private:
    // accessible only inside the class
};
```
---

## 🔷 2. **Access Modifiers**

Access modifiers decide **who can access what** in a class.

| Modifier    | Access Scope                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `public`    | Accessible from **anywhere** (inside or outside class) |
| `private`   | Accessible **only within the class**                   |
| `protected` | (covered in inheritance, used in derived classes)      |

---

### ⚠️ Important:

* By default, **members of a class are `private`**.
* Use `public` for functions that should be accessed from outside.
* Use `private` to **protect sensitive data**.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Term    | Meaning                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Class   | Blueprint to create objects    |
| Object  | Real instance of a class       |
| Public  | Can be accessed from outside   |
| Private | Only accessed within the class |

---

### 🧠 Why Use Access Modifiers?

✅ Helps in **data hiding** (important OOP concept)
✅ Prevents **unauthorized access**
✅ Makes code **secure and modular**

---

### 🔧 Bonus Tip:

You can also declare:

```cpp
class MyClass {
    int x;         // private by default
public:
    int y;
};
```

## OOPs Recap & Nesting of Member Functions:

### 🔷 What is Nesting of Member Functions?

> 📌 **Nesting of member functions** means calling **one member function of a class from another member function** **within the same class**.

This helps break logic into **smaller reusable parts**.

---

### ✅ Example: Simple Program with Nesting

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    int marks1, marks2;

    int totalMarks() {
        return marks1 + marks2;
    }

public:
    void setMarks(int m1, int m2) {
        marks1 = m1;
        marks2 = m2;
    }

    void displayResult() {
        int total = totalMarks();  // nested call
        cout << "Total Marks: " << total << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;
    s.setMarks(85, 90);
    s.displayResult();

    return 0;
}
```

---

🧾 Output:

```
Total Marks: 175
```

---

### 🔍 Explanation:

* `totalMarks()` is a **private function**
* It’s **called inside `displayResult()`**, which is public
* This is **nesting of member functions**

---

## 🔁 Use Case

| Function          | Purpose                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `setMarks()`      | Set values from main function     |
| `displayResult()` | Calls private function internally |
| `totalMarks()`    | Nested inside displayResult()     |

---

## ✅ Key Points

* One member function **can access other members directly**
* You can call a private member function from a **public** one inside the class
* This is useful for breaking large logic into smaller **private helper functions**

---

## ✅ Summary Table

| Concept                  | Description                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Nested Member Function   | Function calling another function of same class |
| Access Modifier Allowed? | Yes, including private if called inside class   |
| Common Use               | Reuse logic, organize code inside a class       |
